# About

Type-safe translation strings for your JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

# Why another localisation module?

Because it's time for a internationalisation project which truly does not
get in your way, does not import unnecessary features, and does not do
unwanted actions.

This project does string interpolation and localisation, and lets you
handle the rest.

# Static validation

Wouldn't it be great if your translation function auto-complete translation
strings out-of-the-box? By using TypeScript analysis, this is quite possible
indeed!

Consider this JSON message file:

```json
// ./messages/fr.json
{
  "authentication": {
    "Username": "Nom d'utilisateur",
    "Password": "Mot de passe",
    "Remember me": "Se souvenir de moi"
  }
}
```

The following translator `t` will provide auto-completion for all available
namespaces, and all strings withing the selected namespace:

```ts
import { translate } from '@foo-i18n/t';
import messages from './messages/fr.json';

const translator = translate(messages);
const t = translator('authentication');

console.log(t('Username'));
// "Nom d'utilisateur"
```

Pretty normal looking, except that all arguments are provided through
auto-completion. Any misspelling or missing translation strings will
immediately be reported by TypeScript.
